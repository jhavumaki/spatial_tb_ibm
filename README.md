# spatial_tb_ibm

1. Set up spatial area with hh_setup_pub.R
2. Run simulation with no active case finding interventions with main_IBM_none_pub.R
3. Calibrate and select resampled parameter sets (calibration file excluded do to data sharing restrictions, but can be made available upon reasonabl request)
4. Run interventions on resampled parameter sets (main_IBM_H_pub for household contact tracing only and main_IBM_HH_pub for household contact tracing and high prevalence grid cell targeting).
